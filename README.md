# ðŸ”Ž SpyRoom

A web-based version of the classic **Spyfall social deduction game**, built with **Next.js Fullstack**.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
The game consists of:
- A **host** creating a game room.  
- Other **players joining the room**.  
- One player being secretly assigned as the **Spy**.  
- A random **location** being assigned (unknown to the Spy).  
- Players asking each other questions IRL to identify the Spy, while the Spy tries to remain undetected.
